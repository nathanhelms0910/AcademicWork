	One of my favorite movies has to be National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. It has a lot of humor and funny scenes. Many of such scenes and jokes my parents and I say all the time in our house in general conversation where appropriate. The movie is one we watch every holiday at least once, and no matter how many times I watch it, I always share a laugh. The actors in the movie are also very great, and part of the reason the comedy in the movie sells so well. Overall, I love this movie and will continue to watch it every year going forward.
