<h3>About Me</h3>
<p id=me>I am a Junior at Longwood University. I am studying for my Bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in Cyber Security, Forensics, and Policy. I am originally from Buffalo, New York.</p>

<h3>About My Family</h3>
<p id=family>My family consists of my mom, my dad, and my pets. I have two dogs and one cat. My mom works at CoStar in downtown Richmond and my dad works at Capital One also in Richmond.</p>

<h3>What I hope to do with my life</h3>
<p id=plans>I hope to work for a company, preferably in the backend, with a team in which I can help work on projects that can better the company. To get there, I plan on first finishing my degree work here at Longwood, and then working out of class wherever possible to extend my knowledge beyond the classroom. Internships are highly important to me, despite how difficult it is to obtain them throughout COVID19 right now. </p>
