<p>When you enter this room, you at first have a breath of relief having just left the growling den of caged up monsters. However, as you finally begin to survey the room, you see a sleeping snake unlike anything you've seen before. Having no means to defend yourself if it awakens and turns hostile, you decide that if you are to move to the room adjacent going forward, you must sneak by carefully.</p>

<p>What is your game plan? If you decide to sneak by carefully to the next room, you run the risk of the beast waking up. However, if you backtrack, you could possibly find another path. However if a beast of this caliber and size is lying dormant in this room, what horrors would the other rooms prior hold? The choice is yours.</p>
