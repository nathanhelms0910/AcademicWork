<h1>Please no Spiders!</h1>
<p>Upon leaving the room full of caged up beasts and monsters, you enter a room that appears to have been left long dormant for some time. Cobwebs take over the area, make it very annoying to get around. "Hopefully there isn't any lurking spiders around...", you think to yourself as you make your way through the seemingly endless cobwebs. When you make your way through to a clearing, you realize there is only one way forward.</p>

<p>"Fantastic", you think to yourself. Finally a break in the endless choice making! However, while not presented through the rooms ahead, a choice still lingers. Will you continue going down this dormant path that has not been messed with in seemingly years or decades even? Or will you make your way back through the way you came in and find a different path?</p>
<br>
<p>The choice, is yours.</p>

<li><a href="left3.html">Continue Forward</a></li>
<li><a href="left1.html">Backtrack To Another Path</a></li>
