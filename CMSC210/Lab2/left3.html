<h1>An Ominous Door</h1>
<p>After deciding that traveling the long forgotten path, you come to find that this room is not nearly as cobweb dusted as the last room! "Creepy spiders..", you think to yourself as you come to the conclusion that the state of the previous chamber was due to a large family of the creatures. It makes you squirm for a moment thinking about it, however you shake it off and then press onward.</p>

<p>Inside this chamber, you find a large door straight ahead of you. Vases of plants line the walls of the room with surprisingly lively floral arrangements. Despite the good feelings the lively plants give off toward the path ahead, the door looks very ominous, like something directly out of a horror movie. It seems like it's safe to pass through, but you take a moment to decide whether the door is worth crossing.</p>
