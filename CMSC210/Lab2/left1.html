<h1>A Risky but Fortunate Move</h1>
<p>Upon entering the area where the mass growling was coming from, you come to realize that all the growling was coming from animals that were caged up. You wish you could help them, but they all seem too feral to control without risking your life, so you choose to ignore them and move on. You see a path to the left and to the right from your current position. Where do you choose to go next?</p>
