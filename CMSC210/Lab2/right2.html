<h1>A Shining Light..</h1>
<p>This room appears empty enough. You see faint but unmistakable traces of light shining through the path going forward. You also see a secondary room to the left that you could also venture down towards. "The light should be the obvious path..", you think to yourself, but then you second guess knowing that dungeons often have traps within.</p>
<br>
<p>Will you follow the traces of light? Or will you venture to the side room? Do not forget that backtracking is always an option too!</p>
