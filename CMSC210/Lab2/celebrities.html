<li><b>Justin Briner</b><p>Justin voices a lot of different animated characters that I like. I got to meet him at a comicon a few years back as well. He is a very sweet person and honestly does a great job for what he does.</p></li>
<li><b>Aaron Dismuke</b><p>Aaron is another voice actor for different animated series. One of the most notable series that I watch that he voices in is called RWBY. He voices a character named Oscar and honestly he is my favorite character in the show and Aaron does such a good job voicing him.</p></li>
