<h1>An Unfortunate Fate</h1>
<p>You enter the seemingly empty room to find out that there was a sleeping monster inside. Your loud noise walking when entering the room awakes the beast, and knocks you unconscious before you can think. When you wake up, you realize you have been sent back to the beginning of the maze. Unfortunate!</p>
