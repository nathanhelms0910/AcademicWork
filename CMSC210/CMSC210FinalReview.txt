1) GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: gandalf.cs.longwood.edu

2) POST requests are never cached

3) Allows to check Content-Length of a file without actually fetching it

4) GET requests can be stored by the web browser in the link, which is harmful because of "shoulder surfers"
GET requests also have restrictions on length.

5) The HTTP version. Usually depicted (if HTTP 1.1) as HTTP/1.1

6) If a Status Code of 301 is given, the payload will be a redirect to the new location of the file, image, or other
document

7) A search engine, or a screen reader

8) Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure - It is slower but more encrypted than HTTP

13) Singleton tag: <br>
Pair of open/close tags: <a></a>

14) Absolute Path: <img src="http://example.org/images/castle.png" alt="Castle Picture"/>
Relative URL: <img src="/images/castle.png" alt="Castle Picture"/>

15) Less Than: &lt;
Non-breaking Space: &nbsp;

16) <head></head> tags, and inside the <title> tag is required and the <meta> tag is required

17) The <br/> tag is a line break, while the <hr/> is the horizontal rule tag

18) The <h2> element is larger by default than the <h4> element

19) Ordered, Unordered, Dictionary. <ol> <ul> and <dl> respectively

<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Price</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yo-yo</td>
<td>$1.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Granola Bars</td>

29) sidebar {
    float: right;
}

30) transform: rotate(45deg);

31) Bitmap images are neat pixel arrays that compress nice but do not scale well. Vector graphics are collections of
lines and shapes that can scale to different sizes easily, which is good for the web

32) <circle cx=5 cy=15 r=10/>

33) 

34) The one that will be drawn on top, is the last shape declared. For example, if you write code to draw a triangle,
but then write code afterwards to draw a circle, the circle would overlap the triangle on the image

35) var defines variables in a function scope, while let defines variables in a block scope. Block scope is better 
because it is good coding practice to define variables only for the block/blocks that they are being used in.

36) alert() for error message in browser
console.log() for the development console

37)

38) 

39) == is used for comparing two variables, ignoring data type. === is used for comparing variables too, but it also
takes into account the data type and checks it. So in this example, 3 == "3" is true because of the ignorance of type,
but 3 === "3" would not be true because "3" is considering a string variable, not an integer

48) HTML: Content; CSS: Presentation; Control: Javascript, JQuery

49) For blind people, add audio options to the web pages for visual elements. For deaf people, add subtitles to videos
and other multimedia that involves audio. For colorblind users, add alt text or subtitles underneath important colors
to help distinguish to the user what the colors are meant to be.

50) Python. Definitely Python. It has opened up a lot of potential for me to grow as a programmer and learn skills
that are very popular in the world of programming
