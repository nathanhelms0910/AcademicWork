1) A Depressed Supersymmetry Typewriter Decerebrates the Costumed Reactionism Outsider


2) perl slowloris.pl -dns [www.example.com] -options


3) When I try to load the localhost:9998 page, it does not load anything and continuously attempts to load the page. From the looks of the Slowloris console, Slowloris is periodically sending packets of data to the browser to prevent it from loading the page. 


4) If I had to guess about the efficiency of Frodo despite the Slowloris attacks, my guess is that the Slowloris attacks only work withan existing client on the same instance. If my friend in the class was to perform his Slowloris attack at the same time I was on frodo, my belief is it would only impact his own login instance of frodo, and not mine or other student's instances. Also, it seems that whenSlowloris sends packets, it sends packets to only the specific localhost. This means other students who ssh into frodo would not feel any

5) In the netcat server window, I see a GET request with a payload of /myfile.html under HTTP/1.1. Full request is as follows:


GET /myfile.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9876
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

As for responding to the server with HTTP/1.1 200 OK, that did not make the browser return the page I was looking for

9) nikto -host torvalds.cs.longwood.edu

10) One potential problem that nikto may run into when ran against torvalds is that it may detect some insecure files and programs, or server and software misconfigurations
