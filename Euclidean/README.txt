Project name: Euclidean 
Project collaborators: Morgan Magner, Nathan Helms, Nikolas Lethco, Trenton Taylor

The goal of this project was to create a program that would utilize the A* algorithm in order to find the shortest possible path through a maze.

To make: type "make"

To run a maze using Euclidean distance: type "./Euclidean map.txt", specificing which number map you want to run.

To run a maze using Manhattan distance: type "./Manhattan map.txt:, specifying which number map you want to run. 

TO generate a random map: type "./Mapgen", and then provide the necesarry integers for input
