CMSC442 - Lab 5: Filesys

All functions coded according to the lab handout
Modifed Files: operations.cpp, filesys.h

for testing:

I wrote test cases into main via different void functions. Comment/uncomment each test case individually in main() to test them

GLITTER:

- Added Read/Write Only parts to the FileHandle when opening a file and checking for each in the read() and write() functions respectively

- Added mv() filesystem function for moving files
