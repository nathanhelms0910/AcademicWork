I have often wondered whether or not the world would be a better place without soup. Soup has a
narcotic effect that few recognize, but that can lull the unsuspecting consumer into a false sense
of security. Would there be fewer crimes if soup were illegal? And what would the cost be? Sure,
Campbell's would make a little less money. But isn't the good of the many, the populace, much more
important than the excess profits of a few wealthy business owners? Surely not! Therefore, we must
take drastic action against the soup-lords who keep us chained to their slums. Computer Scien Reeeeeece
